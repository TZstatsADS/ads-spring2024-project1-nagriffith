### [Do people find more happiness in exercise or leisure?](doc/Proj1_desc.md)


Term: Spring 2024

+ Project title: Leisure or Exercise? What to do to achieve happiness and how does this change over time?
+ This project is conducted by Nicolette Auld-Griffith

+ Project summary: People always say that being active brings you happiness. There's been scientific research about the increase in seretonin levels and generally when you are active, you are in a healthier state which can also bring happiness. Some people grew up playing sports or some found interests in athletic activities later on in life, but it is evident that being active can bring happiness. On the flip side, life can be stressful- and when life is stressful, participating in activties that are considered as leisure would be more enjoyable and bring more happiness. After a long day at work or school or taking care of kids, sometimes happiness comes from relaxing rather than being active. In this project, I wanted to explore the difference between exercise and leisure being a source of happiness.
